A minimal showcase of the developers that came to the Git & GitHub workshop at Hack the North 2021!

# Profiles

To add yourself to the list, you'll need to modify `profiles.json` - the API reads data from that specific file as a rudimentary persistent data source.

`profiles.json` merely contains an array of `Profile`s, which are defined to be:

```typescript
interface Profile {
	name: string // Your name
	github?: string // Github username
	twitter?: string // Twitter username
	insta?: string // Instagram username
	description: string // Minimal description about you!
	profileUrl: string // Image of yourself (you can host on imgur.com or some other hosting site)
}
```

To add yourself to the website, you'll need to add another object to the array listed in `profiles.json`.

To make sure your PR has the highest change of being reviewed, you must:

1. Create an issue using the "New Profile" template and fill it out using your proposal.
2. Edit `profiles.json` according to your own profile on your fork, and make a PR mentioning your corresponding issue.
3. Fix any merge conflicts, iteration procedures and/or build errors (your PR will be merged as soon as all checks pass & one of the moderators approves it).

# Development - If you're interested in going a bit deeper!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Cloning

After forking the repository, run the following to get it onto your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/oss.git
cd oss
git status
```
